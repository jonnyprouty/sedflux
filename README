--- Compiling and installing sedflux ---

The ew package requires glib version 2.6 or newer.  This latest version can
be downloaded from www.gtk.org.  Alternatively, the latest version that is
currently being used in ew is available at ftp://instaar.colorado.edu/pub/ew.


--- Installing glib ---

If you do not have glib installed on your machine, you must install it before
installing the ew package.

1) unzip and un-tar the distribution.

gunzip glib-2.0.6.tar.gz
tar xvf glib-2.0.6.tar

2) create a build directory

mkdir glib-build; cd glib-build

3) configure the package.  Here you must decide where you want to install the
glib package.  If you do not specify the prefix argument, then it will be
installed in /usr/local.  When i want to install it in my home directory,
i use /home/plum/huttone/my_progs/glib inplace of GLIB_DIR. Prereqs for building
on Ubuntu 20.04 include flex and libtool.

../glib-2.0.6/configure --prefix=GLIB_DIR

4) make the package

make

5) install the package

make install

If everything went ok, then glib should be installed in GLIB_DIR.  Now you can
install the ew package.  The steps are nearly the same.

--- Installing sedflux ---

1) unzip and un-tar the distribution.

gunzip ew-1.5.tar.gz
tar xvf ew-1.5.tar

2) create a build directory

mkdir ew-build; cd ew-build

3) configure the package.  Here you must decide where you want to install the
glib package.  If you do not specify the prefix argument, then it will be
installed in /usr/local.  When i want to install it in my home directory,
i use /home/plum/huttone/my_progs/ew inplace of EW_DIR.  Also, you need to
specify where the glib library and header files are found.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=GLIB_DIR/lib CPPFLAGS='-IGLIB_DIR/include/glib-2.0 -IGLIB_DIR/lib/glib-2.0/include' ../ew-1.5/configure --prefix=EW_DIR

Again, GLIB_DIR and EW_DIR are the directories where glib is installed and 
where you want ew installed.  To speed things up, configure can cache the 
results of checks.  To turn this on, pass the option --config-cache to
configure.

4) make the package

make package

The ew package is now installed in EW_DIR.  The executables are located in the
EW_DIR/bin.  Specifically, sedflux is run using EW_DIR/bin/runsedflux.  Some
input files and matlab files (used to view output) can be found in 
EW_DIR/share.

--- compiling on cygwin ---

When compiling on cygwin, i turn off shared libraries.  To do this, pass the following command line arguments to configure:

--disable-shared --enable-static

I believe that both arguments are needed but am not sure and iniclude them both just in case.

--- compiling on 64 bit solaris ---

first note that if compiling a 64 bit version of sedflux, you will nees a 64 bit version of glib.  the procedure for creating a 64 bit glib is the same as that for sedflux.  also, for this compilation i am using the following programs,

autoconf-2.57
automake-1.7.7
libtool-1.5

i'm not certain that these versions are necessary but that's just what i've been using.

compiling a 64 bit version of sedflux is a little more tricky.  not much though.  first, gcc does not compile 64 bit so i have been using the compiler that comes with the forte 7 developers kit.  to make sure that the configure script uses the correct comipiler and linker i define the following variables before i run configure:

CC=/usr/local/lang/bin/cc
LD=/usr/ccs/bin/sparcv9/ld

also, we have to make sure that we link with the 64 bit libraries,

LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/sparcv9 -L/usr/ucblib/sparcv9"

finally, we must pass the correct flags to the compiler,

CFLAGS="-xarch=v9b -xCC"

alternatively, if you would like to optimize the code you may want to try,

CFLAGS="-fast -xarch=v9b -xCC -xautopar -xO5"

of course LDFLAGS should also include the path to the 64 bit glib and CPPFLAGS still needs to be defined as above to point to the correct glib header files.

--- compiling for OSF1 V5.1 ---

I have found that when compiling for dec alpha, I need to do the following:

- Add '-mieee -pthread' to CFLAGS
- Add '-lrt' to LDFLAGS

For example:

setenv CPPFLAGS '-I/export/home3/gjouet/local/include/glib-2.0 -I/export/home3/gjouet/local/lib/glib-2.0/include -I/export/home3/gjouet/local/include'
setenv LDFLAGS '-L/export/home3/gjouet/local/lib -lrt'
setenv CFLAGS '-mieee -pthread -O3'
../../src/ew-1.13/configure --prefix=/export/home3/gjouet/local/ew113 --config-cache
make package
